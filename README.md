# Get-Me-Home-Safe
A basic Android app that pulls data about individual crimes within the local area and displays them on a map, made as an A-Level Computer Science project.
This was my first attempt at developing an Android app so if you see anything I could have done better please don't be afraid to submit a pull request with any changes.
